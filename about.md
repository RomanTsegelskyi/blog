---

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on Microsoft Office Engineering. Previously I worked as a research assistant at the S3 lab, while completing my MSc in Computer Science at Purdue University under Fulbright Fellowship. Back in Ukraine, I worked in NetCracker Tech. as a Junior Customer Support Engineer on Telus Project.


I'm interested in all aspects of programming, with my primary research interests laying a broad areas of programming languages, compilers and optimization. I mostly program in R, Perl, C#, Go and Rust nowadays, but I am have experience with C/C++, Java, Python, and SQL programming. I would like to consider myself a tool builder, I enjoy developing tools that make programmers' lives easier.
