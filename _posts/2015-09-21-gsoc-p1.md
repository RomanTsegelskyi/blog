For the last 2 years, I have been lucky enough to be selected and participate in [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) with [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/), working on different aspects of [pander](rapporter.github.io/pander) package. I felt that review of my experience and work done is getting a bit overdue, so I decided to do a 2-part write up about ideas, achieved results and gained experinces participating in GSoC.

### What is pander?

 [pander](rapporter.github.io/pander) is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package mainly developed and maintained by [Gergely Daroczi](https://about.me/daroczig) that provides helper functions and a generic S3 method to render various types of R objects into [pandoc's markdown](http://pandoc.org/) format that can be converted further to HTML, PDF, docx, odt and other document formats that pandoc supports. A quick example of power of `pander`:

 ```r
> data(warpbreaks, package = "datasets")
> ct <- CrossTable(warpbreaks$wool, warpbreaks$tension,
+                  dnn = c("Wool", "Tension"))

> pander(ct, plain.ascii = TRUE)

------------------------------------------------------------
               Tension                                      
    Wool          L           M           H         Total   
------------ ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
     A                                                      
     N           9           9           9          27      
Chi-square       0           0           0                  
  Row(%)     33.3333%    33.3333%    33.3333%    50.0000%   
 Column(%)      50%         50%         50%                 
  Total(%)    16.6667%    16.6667%    16.6667%              

     B                                                      
     N           9           9           9          27      
Chi-square       0           0           0                  
  Row(%)     33.3333%    33.3333%    33.3333%    50.0000%   
 Column(%)      50%         50%         50%                 
  Total(%)    16.6667%    16.6667%    16.6667%              

   Total         18          18          18          54     
              33.3333%    33.3333%    33.3333%

```

The package can be used as a standalone tool for literate programming building on the traditions of [brew](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brew/brew.pdf), or can be also used inside of e.g. [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) or other markdown-based tools to render nice tables and other textual forms. It provides a wide variety of different options for rendering markdown and [supports 67](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/) different R classes.

### Why pander?

Prior to GSoC 2014 I was lucky enough to get exposure to R programming. Durning my undergradute at [Kyiv Polytechnic Institute](http://kpi.ua/), I took some online courses about data science that used R and even did a project of classifying spam using Naive Bayes and SVM. Moreover, when I started my graduate studies at [Purdue University](cs.purdue.edu), I got envolved with [S3 lab]() and [fastR](). So taking all this into consideration, I was looking for something to (a) use my previous experience with R and (b) get to use R from different dimension, so GSoC and pander looked like a great fit.

### My plan for GSoC 2014

* splitting table with vector values (absolute and relative column width), hyphenation with koRpus
* rewriting table.expand with Rcpp
* new S3 methods

#### Work on colums and etc

#### Rewriting core functionality with Rcpp

#### new S3 methods 

### Summary of work done

* commits
* pull requests
* new S3 classes
* bugs fixed

Some personal story/experience
