For the last 2 years, I have been lucky enough to be selected and participate in Google summer of code with R Project, working on different aspects of [Pander] package. I felt that review of my experience and work done is getting overdue, so I decided to post about what I did during those 2 years.

### What is pander?

### My plan for GSoC 2014

* splitting table with vector values (absolute and relative column width), hyphenation with koRpus
* rewriting table.expand with Rcpp
* new S3 methods

#### Work on colums and etc

#### Rewriting core functionality with Rcpp

#### new S3 methods 

### Summary of work done

* commits
* pull requests
* new S3 classes
* bugs fixed

Some personal story/experience
