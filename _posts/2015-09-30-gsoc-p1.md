title: Google Summer of Code and Pander - Part I
comments: True
---

For the last 2 years, I have been lucky enough to be selected and participate in [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) with [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/), working on different aspects of [pander](rapporter.github.io/pander) package. I felt that some kind of review of my experience and work done is getting a bit overdue, so I decided to do a 2-part write up about original plans, achieved results and gained experiences participating in GSoC. I hope that those 2 articles serve as a reasonable example to people who are considering participating as to one of the possible projects to participate in GSoC possible.

### What is pander?

 [pander](rapporter.github.io/pander) is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package mainly developed and maintained by [Gergely Daroczi](https://about.me/daroczig) that provides helper functions and a generic S3 method to render various types of R objects into [pandoc's markdown](http://pandoc.org/) format that can be converted further to HTML, PDF, docx, odt and other document formats that pandoc supports. A quick example of power of `pander`:

 ```r
> data(warpbreaks, package = "datasets")
> ct <- CrossTable(warpbreaks$wool, warpbreaks$tension,
+                  dnn = c("Wool", "Tension"))

> pander(ct, plain.ascii = TRUE)

------------------------------------------------------------
               Tension                                      
    Wool          L           M           H         Total   
------------ ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------

   Total         18          18          18          54     
              33.3333%    33.3333%    33.3333%              
------------------------------------------------------------
```

The package can be used as a standalone tool for literate programming building on the traditions of [brew](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brew/brew.pdf), or can be also used inside of e.g. [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) or other markdown-based tools to render nice tables and other textual forms. It provides a wide variety of different options for rendering markdown and [supports 67](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/) different R classes.

### Why pander?

Prior to GSoC 2014 I was had some reasonable exposure to R programming. During my undergraduate at [Kyiv Polytechnic Institute](http://kpi.ua/), I took some online courses about data science that used R and even did a project of classifying spam using Naive Bayes and SVM (which was rather easy task to do in R). Moreover, when I started my graduate studies at [Purdue University](http://cs.purdue.edu), I got involved with [S3 lab](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/sss/projects/s3/) and [fastR](https://bitbucket.org/allr/fastr). So taking all this into consideration, I was looking for something to (a) use my previous experience with R and (b) get to use R from different dimension, so GSoC and pander looked like a great fit.

### My plan for GSoC 2014

While I worked on many small things here and there, and besides documentation and testing, my main goals stated in the proposal for the summer were:

* [extend generic S3 method with new classes](.#adding-new-s3-methods)
* [absolute and relative column width, hyphenation with koRpus](.#adding-configurable-column-width)
* [optimize pandoc.table](#rewriting-core-functionality-with-rcpp)

My full application is available [here](https://github.com/RomanTsegelskyi/pi-blog/raw/gh-pages/_includes/gsoc-2014.pdf).

#### Adding new S3 methods

First, I have started with extending generic S3 method. Here is the list of methods that I have implemented:

* [pander.CrossTable](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/62)
* [pander.ts](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/68)
* [pander.formula](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/69)
* [pander.zoo](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/70)
* [pander.lme](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/71)
* [pander.coxph](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/72)
* [pander.survdiff](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/79)
* [pander.mtable](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/80)
* [pander.survfit](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/81)
* [pander.stat.table](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/82)
* [pander.smooth.spline](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/83)
* [pander.clogit](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/84)
* [pander.rlm](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/85)
* [pander.microbenchmark](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/107)

This was a good way for me to get up to speed with `pander`. Typically, `pander.*` methods were based on respective `print.*` methods with some modifications for before calling `pandoc.table`. However, some of the methods, for example `pander.CrossTable` and `pander.mtable` required a complete rewrite to naturally fit with how table can be represented with markdown. Generally, most complications would come would come from lack of support of row- and col-spanning cells in markdown or multi-line cells.

#### Adding configurable column width

After getting more familiar with `pander`, my next step was to implement configurable width support. Prior to that `pander` supported single value for all the columns, which was a bit limiting in some cases. Roughly the work was divided into 3 parts:

1) *Allowing to specify max width of the columns separately* - [Pull request #90](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/90).

The implementation was based around such principles:

  * If `split.cells` is just a number, behavior is the same as before.
  * First value in `split.cells` goes for row names, if there are no row names, then it goes for first param.
  * If `length(split.cells) == number of columns`, then there is one max.width for every column and for rownames (if they exists) default value will be used
  * If `length(split.cells) == number of columns + 1`, then first value in split.cells if for row names, and others are for columns.
  * All extra value in `split.cells` vector are discarded.
  * If `split.cells` does not have enough values for all columns, warning is produced and default values are added for other columns.

The examples of all the cases can be found in the [pull request](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/90).

2) *Break lines in cells, even in case when there are no white spaces, use hyphenation where needed* - [Pull request #93](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/93)
	
Next, I have added support for easier handling of multi-line cells using hyphening when needed. It was implemented by using hyphenation algorithms from [koRpus](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/koRpus/index.html) package with some manipulation of text based on `nchar`.
Generally it follows all the same rules as split of large cells, just when `use.hyphening` option is enabled, it will try to split.words using line breaks also.

```
d> df <- data.frame(a="Machiavellianism", b="Hypervitaminosis")
d> pander(df, split.cells=10)

---------------------------------
       a                b        
---------------- ----------------
Machiavellianism Hypervitaminosis
---------------------------------
d> pander(df, split.cells=10, use.hyphening = TRUE)

-------------------
    a         b    
--------- ---------
 Machi-   Hypervit-
avellian- aminosis 
   ism             
-------------------
```

3) *Allowing to specify relative width of columns* - [Pull request #96](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/96).

Lastly, I have added support of supplying `split.cells` as a vector with percentage values. It is relative to `split.tables` parameter, meaning that in that case `split.tables` becomes a `max.width` for a table. The implementation imposes a requirement that value is supplied for every column and rownames and that relative width sums to 100%. After the work done in previous parts, this particular change was rather straightforward, since it was mostly about converting percentages to numbers and using work done in [Pull request #90](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/90).
	
#### Rewriting core functionality with Rcpp

In summer 2014 I attended [useR 2014](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/) in LA and went to 2 workshops on Rcpp. I got really impressed with the power that Rcpp gives and was eager to use it. Since I was planning to work on improving performance of `pandoc.table` and had some experience with C++ that also seemed to be a great fit.

I did the changes required in 2 parts:

1) I implemented Rcpp version of `splitLine` in [PR #101](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/101). `splitLine` was a helper function that broke the long lines into multiple lines to allow multi-line cells and help enforce predefined cell width. Code for Rcpp version looks more or less similar to the one in R, just a bit more modular. Most hard thing about writing things in Rcpp is debugging, since as far as I know there is no "IDE-like" experience for that, which leaves either printing or using `gdb/lldb`. 

2) After that, I took on the implementing `table.expand` in [PR #105](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/105). I focused on `table.expand`, because despite it's rather small size, it does all the work for actually printing the table (everything else in `pandoc.table` are arguments processing, sanity checks and preparation). Since originally Gergely wrote [table.expand](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/105/files?diff=unified#diff-06d98d59ee432a4a652caa361f1bfda5L531) in pretty idiomatic R heavily using vector functions like `sapply/lapply`, which made the task for translating it into Rcpp a bit harder and thus more interesting. For example, I had to write a simplified equivalent of `format`, since I couldn't any C++ equivalent that supported justification.

The performance improvement for `table.expand` was great (the minimal I saw what 10x, with average of 15x):

```
> b1
Unit: microseconds
                   expr      min      lq   median      uq      max neval
           table.expand  711.426 743.061 810.3655 863.430 2219.897   100
        tableExpand_cpp   57.685  64.676  84.1530 100.071  476.688   100
> b2
Unit: microseconds
                   expr        min        lq    median       uq      max neval
           table.expand   1929.499 1989.7145 2066.2760 2599.152 4317.919   100
        tableExpand_cpp     58.566   65.9905   85.2165   96.538  167.777   100
> b3
Unit: microseconds
                   expr      min       lq    median       uq      max neval
           table.expand 1366.966 1405.690 1455.6460 1502.291 3627.009   100
        tableExpand_cpp   55.687   67.638   87.1345   96.651  190.005   100
```

But I wasn't that much satisfied with 1.5 - 5x speed up achieved for `pandoc.table.return`. For example:

* Small data.frame

```
> b.old.simple
Unit: milliseconds
                                                         expr      min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(data.frame(a = "foo\\nbar"), keep.line.breaks = TRUE) 5.501682 6.224382 7.290573 8.382554 12.23485   100
> b.new.simple
Unit: milliseconds
                                                         expr     min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(data.frame(a = "foo\\nbar"), keep.line.breaks = TRUE) 2.30613 2.587211 2.924714 3.806796 5.605237   100
```
* mtcars

```
> b.old.mtcars
Unit: milliseconds
                             expr      min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(mtcars, style = "simple") 192.7679 201.4737 206.0359 210.8648 282.0304   100
> b.new.mtcars
Unit: milliseconds
                             expr     min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(mtcars, style = "simple") 66.4057 73.86317 76.89688 83.96956 119.5512   100
```

* volcano

```
> b.old.volcano
Unit: seconds
            expr      min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(volcano) 4.408776 4.415709 4.479123 4.513334 4.536083    10
> b.new.volcano
Unit: seconds
            expr      min       lq   median       uq      max neval
 pander(volcano) 3.502687 3.545587 3.583752 3.634691 3.850749    10
```

I think that the main causes for the less speed-up is the recursive call in `pandoc.table.return` when splitting large table.

### Aftermath

Some statistics of my work during this awesome experience:

* 127 commits
* 40 accepted pull requests
* 14 new pander methods
* 4026 lines inserted, 1459 lines deleted
* 4 bugs fixed

But those numbers don't reflect more important change that I think GSoC is about. I was able to participate in something that is largely used and was able to contribute to R community while learning a lot about R package development (for example documenting with [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), testing with [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html) and CI with [Travis](travis-ci.org)). All in all, it was such a great experience that I was happy to return for GSoC 2015...
