title: Creating R package with modern tools
comments: True
---

Recently, I have finished and succesfully released my first R package - yummlyr, and decided a short article on creating R packages. There are different manuals that can be found over the internet, but I wanted something modern, or in short a simplified version of Hadley's R packages book. 

### What is an R package?

For me, R packages was one of the most fundumental things of the language. Essentially, it's a well defined format for distributing R code through CRAN. It took it's idea from CPAN, but outgrew the competition greately and now holds over 7000 packages. 

### Why bother creating an R package?

### How to create a packages

* Through new RStudio project
* Using `package.skeleton`
* Using `devtools::create`

### Structure of a package

After creating a package with RStudio or devtools, you are most likely to see the following structure. 

**Insert a picture here***

It countains the following files/directories:

* DESCRIPTION - description of the package with different characteristics
* NAMESPACE - file that specifies functions that are exported by your package 
* R - a directory that holds R code
* man - directory with function documentation
* .RBuildIgnore - file that specified files excluded from the package building

Files/directories that are not created by default, but are also important:

* src - directory with source code for compiled files, typically Rcpp, sometimes C/C++ or Fortran.
* vignette - directory with long documentation in form of vignettes. This is different from man in a way that it usually describes user scenarios or implementation details, while `man` typically documents single functions.
* tests - directory that contains test files
* inst - header/things specific for installation

#### R source code and data

#### Compiled code

#### Tests and continious integration

#### Function documentation

#### Vignettes

#### CRAN submission and revdep
