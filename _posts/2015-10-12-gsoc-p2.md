This article is the second part of the review of participation in GSoC with R project working on pander package. First part is available here. 

### My plan for GSoC 2015

While I worked on many small things here and there, and besides documentation and testing, my main goals stated in the proposal for the summer were:

* [extend generic S3 method with new classes](.#adding-new-s3-methods)
* [refactor pandoc.table and evals](.#adding-configurable-column-width)
* [extend test-suite and improve test coverage](#rewriting-core-functionality-with-rcpp)
* [improve documentation and create topic specific vignettes](#rewriting-core-functionality-with-rcpp)

My full application is available [here](https://github.com/RomanTsegelskyi/pi-blog/raw/gh-pages/_includes/gsoc-2014.pdf).

#### Adding new S3 methods

First, I have started with extending generic S3 method. Here is the list of methods that I have implemented:

* [pander.CrossTable](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/62)
* [pander.ts](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/68)
* [pander.formula](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/69)
* [pander.zoo](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/70)
* [pander.lme](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/71)
* [pander.coxph](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/72)
* [pander.survdiff](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/79)
* [pander.mtable](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/80)
* [pander.survfit](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/81)
* [pander.stat.table](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/82)
* [pander.smooth.spline](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/83)
* [pander.clogit](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/84)
* [pander.rlm](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/85)
* [pander.microbenchmark](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/107)

#### Testing

#### Refactoring pandoc.table and evals, linting

#### Documentation and vignettes

### Aftermath

Some statistics of my work during this awesome experience:

* 127 commits
* 40 accepted pull requests
* 14 new pander methods
* 4026 lines inserted, 1459 lines deleted
* 4 bugs fixed

But those numbers don't reflect more important change that I think GSoC is about. I was able to participate in something that is largely used and was able to contribute to R community while learning a lot about R package development (for example documenting with [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), testing with [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html) and CI with [Travis](travis-ci.org)). All in all, it was such a great experience that I was happy to return for GSoC 2015...
