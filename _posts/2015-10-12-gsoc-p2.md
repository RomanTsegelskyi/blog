This article is the second part of the review of participation in GSoC with R project working on pander package. First part is available [here](http://romantsegelskyi.github.io/pi-blog//2015/09/30/gsoc-p1/). 

### My plan for GSoC 2015

While I worked on many small things here and there, and besides documentation and testing, my main goals stated in the proposal for the summer were:

* [extend generic S3 method with new classes](.#adding-new-s3-methods)
* [refactor pandoc.table and evals](.#adding-configurable-column-width)
* [extend test-suite and introduce unified coding style](#rewriting-core-functionality-with-rcpp)
* [improve documentation and create topic specific vignettes](#rewriting-core-functionality-with-rcpp)

My full application is available [here](https://github.com/RomanTsegelskyi/pi-blog/raw/gh-pages/_includes/gsoc-2014.pdf).

#### Adding new S3 methods

This year, as well as last year I worked on extending generic S3 method with new supported classes:

* [pander.tabular](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/161)
* [pander.summary.table](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/181)
* [pander.randomForest](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/184)
* [pander.gtable](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/198)
* [pander.irts](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/197)
* [pander.nls/summary.nls](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/199)
* [pander.manova/summary.manova](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/202)
* [pander.arima](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/210)
* [pander.ols/rms/Glm/cph/lrm/summary.rms](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/212)
* [pander.polr/summary.polr](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/217)
* [pander.survreg/summary.survreg](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/218)

This effort is the one I am particularly proud of, since overall while working on `pander` I added around 30 new S3 methods, bringing the total number to 73 and making `pander` of the most covering packages among the once with similar functionality like `xtable`, `ascii` etc. 

#### Testing

Between GSoC 2014 and GSoC 2015 Jim Hester created [covr](https://github.com/jimhester/covr/) package for measuring test coverage. Around the same time I was also inverstigating possibilities to measure R code coverage as part of my [research](https://github.com/allr/rcov), so I was searching for work done and covr presented a robust and general solution for the problem. Since it was quickly picked up by [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io) and [codecov.io](https://codecov.io), so I integrated it in `pander`'s Travis configuration as soon as it was [available](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/151). The existing test suite in `pander` gave 54% coverage, which was a good start, but not enough, since I wanted to do the refactoring and wanted more robust testing before that. So firstly, I decided to extend the test suite. As most of uncovered code was in S3 methods, which made me thing what is the best way to test such methods. After some evaluation, I decided to test the length of output and some characteristics certain not to change even in underslying implementation of `pandoc.table` changes. 

**Add pull requests here.**

While working on that I also realized that due to limitations in R, covr won't treat one line if statements correctly. So this emergend into big refactoring, to combine linting and change of braces which was implemented in [PR #196](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/196) with addition of [PR #215](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/215) when I figure out how to create a linter to enforce single quotes. 

All those efforts brought coverage to 78%, which we considered good, since large uncovered area in evals is hard to test, however that might change once robust package like [vtest](https://github.com/wch/vtest) is developed for R. 

#### Refactoring pandoc.table and evals

Over the time `pandoc.table` and `evals` grew to be rather complex functions, which made it much harder to introduce any new functionality. So I embarced the idea to refactor them. 

My first destination was to refactor `pandoc.table`, which I have refactored in [PR#186](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/186). As Gergely pointed out, a lot of redundant complexity in `pandoc.table` comes from the fact that it supports input of different dimensions, which in turn required a lot of checks to overcome that. I implemented an intermediate representation in [91564e5](https://github.com/RomanTsegelskyi/pander/commit/91564e53ab01327efa1ee890bf6a048e998abf18), which total allowed to remove more than 50 lines from `pandoc.table.return` and made the function more readable. Also that allowed me to fix 2 old bugs: [#164](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues/164) and [#186](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/186). 

After that, I refactored `evals` and finish implementation of [logging](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/124) (most of which was implemented by Gergely). Most of the refactoring in `evals` were rather straightforward, especially because a large portion of the code is centered around style unification. 

#### Documentation and vignettes

One of the other objectives was to improve the documentation. `pander` was already mature package, but it didn't have vignettes, which some people still prefer as the source of documentation. Moreover, Gergely had an idea to post vignettes at http://rapporter.github.io/pander/, to be able to refer to the in StackOverflow question for example. I have created 4 vignettes:

* [Using pander with knitr](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/knitr.html)
* [Rendering markdown with pander](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/pander.html)
* [Rendering tables with pandoc.table](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/pandoc_table.html)
* [Capturing evaluation information with evals](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/evals.html)

The best part was learning to use [knitr] for writing vignettes, which in my opinion is a great simplification from how it was done before. There exists a nice starting [guide](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/vignette/), which I greatly recommend.

After finishing writing vignettes and doing updates to README and other parts I had some time left before the end, so I decided to implement Gergely's idea of automatically updating `gh-pages` with Travis. This was quite an interesting experience, probably one of the best this summer, because a) I had no idea that was possible and b) I had no idea how to do that. I implemented that in [PR#220](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pull/220) and even wrote a separate [blog post](http://romantsegelskyi.github.io/pi-blog//2015/09/14/gh-pages-travis/) on the topic, so I won't go into much detail here. 

### Aftermath

Some statistics of my work during this awesome experience:

* 148 commits
* 39 accepted pull requests
* 20 new S3 pander methods
* +8764, -3342 changes through all commits (a lot of this is due to refactoring)
* 7 bugs fixed

I feel that second year of my participation was quite different from the first one. I had more knowledge of the `pander` internals, which I think resulted in a bit more productive work this summer. Even though, I still learned many new things including using [knitr](), [linter](), [logging with futile.logger](), automatically updating `gh-pages` and etc. Looking back I feel gave me a lot hand-on programming experience, which proves to be useful every day. Also I wanted thank Gergely Daroczi for being an awesome mentor and spending all this time reviewing my changes and helping me to grow. GSoC with Pander was definately a remarkable experience.
